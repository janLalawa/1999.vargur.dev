# Who Am I?

I tend to describe myself as a developer, engineer, or writer. Really, I just do a bit of everything.

Here are some of the things I like to do:

- Writing blog posts about game theorycrafting
- Creating new websites or tools
- Drawing, or at least trying to
- 3D printing!
- Learning languages like Japanese, German, and Toki Pona
